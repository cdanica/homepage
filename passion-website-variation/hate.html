        <h1>Reasons Why I Hate Valorant</h1>

        <div class="wingman2"><img src="wingman2.png" width="85"></div>

        <div class="reason-1">1: Random teammates. Sometimes I don't have enough friends to play a full team. So, majority of the time, I'm stuck playing with people who don't know what they're doing, throw my games, or are just straight annoying. People can also just be mean, especially when it comes to girls playing games.</div>

        <div class="reason-2">2: The matchmaking system. Valorant is "supposed" to make matches as even as possible. But, it starts to not make sense when someone is 3 ranks higher than me in the same lobby. People also choose to use "smurf" accounts and get into lower elo lobbies,which is annoying when they're not even in their rank.</div>

        <div class="reason-3">3: The map selection. This one is 50/50 for me because there are maps that I really enjoy, but there are a lot that can make or break my game. This also depends on what character I'm playing because there are only certain ones I can play depending on a map.</div>

        <div class="reason-4">4: It's an addicting game.I could play this game all day if I didn't have other responsibilities. Sometimes, it takes me longer to stop playing than other days. My thought is that I've spent money on this free game, I can't not play it. It's a love-hate relationship.</div>

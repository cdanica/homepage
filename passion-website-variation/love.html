        <div class="reason-1">1: I get to play with friends! A lot of my real life friends play get to play with me all the time. It's also way easier to play with people you already know. It makes communicated easier and messing around more fun.</div>

        <div class="reason-2">2: I love the pretty skins. I am a firm believer in "skin buff" (playing with a skin makes you better). Is it a free game and I chose to spend money on it? Yes, but the skins make me happy, therefore, I have more fun and play better.</div>

        <div class="reason-3">3: I really enjoy the diverse agent select. There are 26 different characters you can play, all having different and unique abilities. Additionally, each agent has different backgrounds and ethnicities.</div>

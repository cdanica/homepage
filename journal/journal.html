            1. A Rant About “Technology”

            This text left me thinking differently about technology. The writer argues that technology is about all the tools and techniques societies use to interact with the physical world, from cooking and building, to programming computers. It’s interesting to think that all science fiction involves technology in some kind of way, even if it’s not the focus. Technology continues to be a part of our daily lives, regardless of complexity. It is a part of how we problem solve and adapt to what is happening around us.
            
            What is a website?
            
            I was left to rethink what a website can be after reading this text. Websites can be more than just files on a server and that they really are creative spaces that can take up different forms, such as a garden or a puddle. Websites are constantly changing and are never truly complete. There will always be something to change or update. With social media constantly taking over the internet, creating a personal website is a way to express who you are outside of those well known platforms. We as artists are given an unique opportunity to shape the future of websites by building our own spaces. The possibilities of creativity are endless when wanting to create something that represents who you are onto the web.

            2. J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web
            
            Carpenter’s article on the “handmade web” has a nostalgic feeling for the early days of the internet when websites were unique, hand-coded creations that reflected individual expressions. With the internet today, it is controlled by corporate platforms and feels less personalized and more standardized. Carpenter’s call to return to handmade web is pretty inspiring. It reminds us to be actual artists and creators, not just consumers. It reminds us to reclaim the internet for our own personal spaces and expressions. It’s encouraging to consider how I can create my own space in the digital realm, keeping the spirit of the early web alive.

            3. Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!
            
            The idea that design is a universal language stood out to me. It’s amazing how simple elements such as colors and layouts can convey different emotions and ideas. I appreciated the focus on combining technology with creativity, showing how tools shape the way we can design. The emphasis on collaboration and feedback reminds me to be open to new ideas. There is a large encouragement to experiment and take risks in design. This reading felt like a good reminder that design isn’t about just looking good. It’s about meanings and connections built through designs.

            4. Callum Copley - A Friend is Writing

            I really enjoyed how simple, yet impactful this website felt. The clean layout and use of whitespace made it feel personal and approachable, almost like reading a handwritten letter. It almost creates an intimate atmosphere, which aligns with the theme of friendship and writing. The content itself felt very thoughtful, genuine, and conversational. It didn’t need to rely on flashy visuals or animations, yet still felt very interactive and meaningful. It was well balanced between storytelling and design.

            5. Mindy Seu - The Poetry of Tools
            
            This felt like a new perspective on how we interact with everyday objects. The idea that tools carry both function and poetry really stuck with me. It made me think about how even the simplest objects hold stories and emotions tied to them. The article’s reflection on how tools shape our creativity and thinking was especially meaningful. It reminded me that tools aren’t just things we use. They influence how we can approach problems and express ideas.

            6. Becaca Abbe, The Internet's Back-to-the-Land Movement
            
            This article made me think about the growing trend of people reconnecting with nature through the use of the internet. The idea of blending technology with a return to simpler, more sustainable living really resonated with me. It’s interesting how digital tools and platforms are helping people really explore new ways of living off the land while still being connected online. It made me reflect on the way we use the internet. Not just for our own conveniences, but as a tool for learning and reconnecting with the environment. It’s a reminder that technology doesn’t have to separate us from nature; it can help us engage with it in meaningful ways. I continue to reflect on how I use technology that aligns with my values, especially pertaining to sustainability and my connection with the natural world.

            7. Frank Chimero, The Good Room
            
            This article really made me reflect on the spaces we create; both physically and digitally. The idea of a “good room” as a space that feels welcoming and true to ourselves was what really stuck with me. Chimero’s reflection on how environments affect our creativity and sense of belonging reminded me of the importance of the spaces we design, whether they are for work or for personal reflections. It made me realize how much the design of a space truly influences the way we feel and think. Whether it’s a room, a website, or a project, a “good room” is one that makes you feel at ease, inspired, open, etc. This left me really thinking about how I can create more thoughtful, intentional spaces in my own works and designs.

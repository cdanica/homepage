        <h2>My relationship with this game is toxic. There are times when I leave the game pissed, but I'll always come back. This free game has also taken up my real life money (please don't ask how much I've spent I'm embarassed). It still remains in a special place in my heart, no matter how mad it makes me.</h2>
